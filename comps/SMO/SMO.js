                  Affiliate Marketing is the term used to describe a form of
                  online advertising which consists of rewarding an affiliate
                  for referring a visitor or rewarding a customer for performing
                  a desired action, such as making a purchase or subscribing to
                  a newsletter. In a way, Affiliate Marketing can be regarded as
                  free publicity for your pageâ€”a network of related websites
                  directing customers to purchase from yours.

                  Affiliate campaigns have the best results when they are
                  combined with Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Pay Per Click
                  (PPC) campaigns, email marketing support and are well-suited
                  for travel, retail, and service industries due to their timely
                  research process/large-volume sales.

                  Effective Affiliate Marketing is not throwing a bunch of links
                  at different website owners in the hopes that something will
                  stick. It is a well-planned, specified effort intended to
                  develop long-term relationships with third party websites,
                  research industry-relevant websites with trusted pages and
                  build up a valuable affiliate network for your website that
                  will bring in quality, converted traffic.

                  Social Media Marketing is in many ways connected as a
                  technique to viral marketing where word of mouth is created
                  not through friends or family but through the use of
                  networking in social book-marking, video and photo sharing
                  websites. In a similar way the engagement with blogs achieves
                  the website popularity by sharing content through the use of
                  RSS in the blogsphere and special blog search engines such as
                  Technorati. Social Media Marketing is closely related to other
                  Online Marketing Techniques, such as Search Engine
                  Optimization, Search Engine Marketing, Viral Marketing Word of
                  Mouth Marketing, and Social Media Optimization.
