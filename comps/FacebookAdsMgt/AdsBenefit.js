              Your brand becomes what you will show to the people. Facebook is
              one of the greatest social media platforms that allow a business
              to target a huge volume of users by estimating who they are, what
              activities they do online along with their interests. It is an
              ultimate platform for lead generation as well as direct sales, as
              it is a stage where you can directly confront the potential
              customers at the place where they spend a major proportion of
              their time.
